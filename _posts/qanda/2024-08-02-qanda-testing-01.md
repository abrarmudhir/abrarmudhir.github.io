question: 'What sorts of tests do you consider when building an application? What testing libraries have you used?'
answer: >-
  When building an application, a comprehensive testing strategy is essential to ensure the software is reliable, 
  performant, and free of defects. Here are the key types of tests to consider:

  - **Unit Tests**: These tests verify that individual components or functions of the application work as expected. 
  They focus on small, isolated pieces of code and are usually written by developers during the coding phase.
    - **Library Used**: **pytest** is a popular library for writing unit tests in Python. It supports fixtures, 
  parameterized testing, and has a simple syntax.
      ```python
      import pytest

      def add(x, y):
          return x + y

      def test_add():
          assert add(1, 2) == 3
      ```

  - **Integration Tests**: These tests check the interaction between different components or systems to ensure 
  they work together correctly. They often involve testing multiple components or services that interact with each other.
    - **Library Used**: **pytest** can also be used for integration tests. **pyunit** (unittest) is another option for 
        writing integration tests in Python.
      ```python
      import unittest

      class TestIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
          def test_service_integration(self):
              # Integration test code
              self.assertTrue(True)
      ```

  - **Functional Tests**: These tests evaluate specific features or functionalities of the application from an end-user 
        perspective. They ensure that the application behaves as expected when specific features are used.
    - **Library Used**: **behave** and **cucumber** are popular libraries for behavior-driven development (BDD), 
        allowing you to write tests in a natural language format.
      ```gherkin
      Feature: Showing off behave

        Scenario: run a simple test
          Given we have behave installed
           When we implement a test
           Then behave should test it for us!
      ```

  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: These tests simulate real user scenarios to validate that the application works 
    end-to-end. They test the complete flow of the application from the user interface to the backend.
    - **Library Used**: **Selenium** and **Cypress** are widely used for E2E testing. **Selenium** allows for browser 
        automation and testing across multiple browsers, while **Cypress** is known for its fast and reliable testing 
        capabilities with a focus on modern web applications.
      ```javascript
      // Example with Cypress
      describe('My First Test', () => {
        it('Visits the app', () => {
          cy.visit('https://example.com')
          cy.contains('Welcome')
        })
      })
      ```

  - **Performance Tests**: These tests evaluate how the application performs under various conditions, such as high 
    load or stress. They help identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the application can handle expected traffic.
    - **Library Used**: While performance testing libraries are often separate, integrating performance testing with 
    your existing suite can involve using tools like **Locust** or **JMeter** in conjunction with your application code.

  - **Security Tests**: These tests identify vulnerabilities and ensure that the application is secure from potential 
    attacks. They are crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining user trust.
    - **Library Used**: Security testing is usually done with specialized tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Burp Suite**. 
    These tools help in performing security assessments and vulnerability scanning.

  - **Regression Tests**: These tests are performed to ensure that new code changes have not adversely affected 
    existing functionality. They are typically automated and run frequently during the development cycle.
    - **Library Used**: **pytest** and **Selenium** can be used to automate regression tests, ensuring that 
    previously fixed issues do not reoccur.

  A robust testing strategy typically involves a combination of these types of tests and tools to ensure 
    comprehensive coverage and high-quality software.
