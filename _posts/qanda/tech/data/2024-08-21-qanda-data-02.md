question: 'How would you design a data pipeline for a real-time analytics application?'
answer: >-
  Designing a real-time data pipeline involves several components:

  - **Data Ingestion**: For real-time ingestion, I would use a streaming platform like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis to 
      collect and transmit data to processing systems.
  - **Data Processing**: Implement stream processing using frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming to 
      transform and aggregate the data in real time.
  - **Data Storage**: Depending on the use case, I might choose a fast, scalable storage solution like Amazon S3 for 
      raw data or Amazon Redshift for structured data that needs to be queried.
  - **Analytics**: For analytics, tools like AWS QuickSight, Power BI, or Tableau can be used to visualize data. 
      In cases where immediate insights are necessary, setting up dashboards with auto-refresh capabilities could be 
      crucial.
  - **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implementing monitoring using AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus for pipeline health and 
      setting up alerts for any anomalies.
