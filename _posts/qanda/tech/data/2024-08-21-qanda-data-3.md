question: 'What strategies would you employ to ensure data quality and consistency across distributed systems?'
answer: >-  
  - **Data Validation Rules**: Implement validation rules at the data ingestion stage to ensure that incoming data 
      meets predefined quality criteria.
  - **Data Governance**: Establish a data governance framework that includes data quality metrics, stewardship roles, 
      and responsibilities. This also includes using tools like Apache Atlas for metadata management.
  - **Master Data Management (MDM)**: Implement MDM practices to create a single source of truth for key business 
      entities, ensuring data consistency across all systems.
  - **Automated Testing**: Utilize unit tests, integration tests, and data profiling tools like Great Expectations to 
      detect data anomalies and inconsistencies early in the pipeline.
  - **Monitoring and Alerting**: Continuous monitoring using tools like Grafana or AWS CloudWatch to detect issues 
      in real-time and set up alerts to handle them proactively.
