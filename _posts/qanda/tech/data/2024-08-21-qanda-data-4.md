question: 'How do you approach the challenge of maintaining both legacy systems and modern cloud-based systems?'
answer: >-    
  - **Hybrid Infrastructure**: I would establish a hybrid infrastructure that allows both systems to coexist, with a 
      clear strategy for integrating legacy systems with modern cloud services.
  - **Incremental Migration**: Gradually migrate components from legacy systems to the cloud. Start with non-critical 
      workloads and build confidence before migrating more critical systems.
  - **Middleware**: Use middleware or integration platforms (like Mulesoft or Azure Logic Apps) to bridge the gap 
      between legacy systems and cloud applications, ensuring smooth data flow and communication.
  - **Data Synchronization**: Implement data synchronization processes, ensuring that data remains consistent 
      and up-to-date across both environments.
  - **Staff Training**: Invest in training and development for team members to handle both legacy and cloud 
      systems effectively.
