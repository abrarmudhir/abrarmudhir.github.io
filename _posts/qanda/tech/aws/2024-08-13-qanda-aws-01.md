question: >-
  A company has multiple data sources stored in different formats on Amazon S3. They want to enable their data analysts 
  to easily discover and access these datasets for analysis. The company needs an efficient way to catalog this data 
  and make it searchable.<br /><br />

  Which AWS service should the company use to automate the creation of a data catalog that makes their datasets in 
  Amazon S3 easily discoverable for analysis?
answer: >-
  Implement an AWS Glue Crawler to scan the data in S3 and automatically populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog.<br /><br />

  AWS Glue Crawler is the most suitable solution for this scenario. It automatically scans data in Amazon S3 and other 
  data stores, infers schemas, and creates metadata tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.<br /><br />

  This enables data analysts to easily discover and access various datasets for analysis. Glue Crawlers can handle 
  multiple data formats and automatically keep the catalog updated with changes in the data structure, 
  reducing the need for manual intervention.
