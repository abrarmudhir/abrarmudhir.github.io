question: 'Can you name a few design patterns?'
answer: >-
  Design patterns are common solutions to recurring problems in software design. They provide templates for solving 
  common design issues and improving code maintainability. Here are a few widely recognized design patterns:

  1. **Singleton Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
  
     - **Usage**: Often used for managing shared resources such as configuration settings or connection pools.
  

  2. **Factory Method Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that 
                    will be created.
     - **Usage**: Useful for creating objects in a super class but allowing subclasses to modify the type of 
                    created objects.

  3. **Observer Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its 
                    dependents are notified and updated automatically.
     - **Usage**: Commonly used in event handling systems, such as in GUI frameworks or message broadcasting systems.

  4. **Decorator Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without 
                    affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
     - **Usage**: Useful for adding responsibilities to objects at runtime, like adding new features to a window in 
                    a graphical user interface.

  5. **Strategy Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
                    Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
     - **Usage**: Ideal for scenarios where multiple algorithms can be used interchangeably, such as different 
                    sorting or compression strategies.

  6. **Adapter Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It acts as a bridge 
                    between two incompatible interfaces.
     - **Usage**: Often used to integrate new features with legacy systems or to make different APIs 
                    compatible with one another.

  7. **Command Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with 
                    queues, requests, and operations.
     - **Usage**: Useful for implementing undo/redo functionality, queuing operations, or logging operations.

  8. **Facade Pattern**:
     - **Purpose**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that 
                    makes the subsystem easier to use.
     - **Usage**: Commonly used to provide a simplified interface to a large body of code, such as a complex 
                    library or framework.

  These design patterns help in creating scalable, maintainable, and flexible codebases by addressing common design 
  issues and providing standardized solutions.
