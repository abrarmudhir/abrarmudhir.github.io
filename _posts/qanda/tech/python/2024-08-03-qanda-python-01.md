question: 'Write a Python function to check whether a given number is prime or not.'
answer: >-
  To determine if a given number is prime, we can create a Python function that checks for factors of the number. 
  A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so the function will need to test divisibility up to the square 
  root of the number for efficiency.
