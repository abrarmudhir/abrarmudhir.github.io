title: 'What frameworks and libraries have you used for application development using Python?'
question: 'Can you provide some examples from your CV?'
answer: >-
  I have used several frameworks and libraries for application development in Python across various projects:

  - **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, essential in building analytics and insights frameworks 
                for financial markets and multi-asset portfolios.
  - **NumPy**: Employed for numerical operations and handling large datasets efficiently, particularly in quantitative 
                and financial modeling.
  - **Dask**: Applied for parallel computing to manage and process large datasets, enhancing performance in 
                data-intensive applications.
  - **FastAPI**: Leveraged to develop high-performance web APIs and microservices, particularly in building modular 
                APIs for data integrations and analytics platforms.
  - **Flask**: Used for creating lightweight web applications, especially in prototyping and rapid development 
                scenarios.
  - **SQLAlchemy**: Integrated as an ORM for seamless interaction with databases, used in data products and ETL 
                pipelines.
  - **Apache Airflow**: Employed for orchestrating ETL pipelines and managing complex workflows in cloud-native 
                data processing environments.
  - **PySpark**: Utilized for processing large datasets on Hadoop, improving data handling and analytics capabilities 
                in financial and data engineering projects.
  - **Beautiful Soup**: Used for web scraping to gather financial and market data efficiently.
  
  - **Scrapy**: Applied for creating robust and scalable web crawlers to extract and process data from various sources.

  These tools have been integral to my roles in data engineering, financial modeling, and application development, 
  enabling efficient data handling, scalable application design, and effective data integration solutions.
