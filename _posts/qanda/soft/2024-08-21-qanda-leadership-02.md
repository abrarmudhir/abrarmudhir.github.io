question: 'How do you approach building and developing a high-performing data engineering team?'
answer: >-
  I focus on hiring individuals with both technical proficiency and a collaborative mindset. Once the team is in place, 
  I invest in their continuous development through mentorship, training programs, and regular feedback sessions. 
  I also promote a culture of ownership, where team members are encouraged to take responsibility for their projects, 
  which fosters innovation and accountability. Regular team-building activities help in aligning the teamâ€™s goals 
  and improving collaboration.
