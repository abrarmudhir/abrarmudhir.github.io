question: 'Imagine you are leading a cloud migration project, and halfway through, the budget gets cut by 30%. How would you adjust your approach?'
answer: >-
  With a reduced budget, I would re-evaluate the scope of the project, focusing on the most critical components that 
  deliver the highest business value. I would consider a phased approach, prioritizing core systems for migration while 
  deferring less critical ones. Additionally, I would explore cost-saving measures such as using more cost-effective 
  cloud services or optimizing existing resources. Clear communication with stakeholders is crucial to align 
  expectations and secure their buy-in for the revised plan.
