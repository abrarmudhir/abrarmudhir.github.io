title: 'Can you describe a time when you led a data migration project?'
question: 'Can you describe a time when you led a data migration project? What were the challenges, and how did you overcome them?'
answer: >-
  At BlackRock, I led a data migration project involving the transition of a legacy investment model platform to a 
  cloud-based solution. The challenges included dealing with complex dependencies, ensuring data integrity, and 
  maintaining performance standards. To overcome these, I employed a phased migration approach, utilized cloud-native 
  tools for data validation, and set up parallel processing to verify results against the legacy system. 
  Regular communication with stakeholders and robust testing protocols ensured a smooth transition.
