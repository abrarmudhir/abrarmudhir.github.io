question: 'How would you handle a situation where the data engineering team is resistant to adopting a new technology?'
answer: >-
  I would start by understanding the root cause of the resistance, which could range from a lack of familiarity with 
  the technology to concerns about its impact on existing workflows. I would then organize training sessions and 
  workshops to address knowledge gaps and demonstrate the benefits of the new technology through proof-of-concept 
  projects. By involving the team in the decision-making process and addressing their concerns directly, 
  I can help ease the transition and build their confidence in the new technology.
