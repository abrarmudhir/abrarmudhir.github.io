question: 'How would you manage a situation where a key project is falling behind schedule?'
answer: >-
  First, I would assess the root causes of the delay by conducting a thorough review of the projectâ€™s progress, 
  including resource allocation, task dependencies, and any unforeseen challenges. I would then re-prioritize tasks, 
  possibly reassigning resources or adjusting the project scope to focus on the most critical deliverables. 
  Communication is key, so I would keep stakeholders informed about the situation and the revised plan to manage 
  expectations. Implementing daily stand-ups and frequent check-ins can help monitor progress more closely and 
  ensure the team stays on track.
