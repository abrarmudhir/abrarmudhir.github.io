question: 'Can you walk us through your CV, focusing on the technologies you have worked with and the projects you have led?'
answer: >-
  Certainly. In my most recent role at Illio Technology Ltd, I led the architecture and implementation of AWS-based ETL 
  pipelines and analytics platforms. This involved using technologies such as AWS Glue, Apache Airflow, Python, and 
  PostgreSQL. One key project was developing serverless data pipelines, leveraging AWS Lambda and API Gateway for 
  efficient API development.

    At BlackRock, as Vice President, I led a team to enhance the Aladdin Alpha Platform. We integrated Snowflake for 
  better data efficiency and implemented secure APIs across .NET, MATLAB, Perl, Python, and Java. I have extensive 
  experience with relational databases like Oracle and MS SQL Server, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. 
  Additionally, I've worked with distributed streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka and ETL tools.

    Earlier in my career at Golden Source Limited, I managed the migration of their Security Master and Pricing product 
  to a cloud-hosted environment and advocated for DevOps practices to improve CI/CD processes.

    Throughout my career, I've consistently used technologies such as Java, Python, React, Kubernetes, and various 
  cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.
