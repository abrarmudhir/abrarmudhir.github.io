question: 'How do you ensure that your team stays updated with the latest technology trends and skills?'
answer: >-
  I prioritise continuous learning and development within my team by encouraging participation in workshops, 
  certifications, and online courses. I also schedule regular knowledge-sharing sessions where team members 
  present new tools, technologies, or methodologies they've explored. Additionally, I foster a culture of 
  experimentation, allowing the team to pilot new technologies on smaller projects before scaling them up.
