title: 'Describe a situation where you had to manage conflicting priorities.'
question: 'Describe a situation where you had to manage conflicting priorities. How did you handle it?'
answer: >-
  During my time at Illio Technology, we had to simultaneously develop a new analytics platform while maintaining an 
  existing data pipeline. The key was to establish clear communication channels with stakeholders to prioritise tasks 
  based on business impact. I used Agile methodologies to manage workloads, ensuring that the team focused on 
  high-priority tasks during sprints while allocating buffer time for urgent maintenance work. This approach 
  allowed us to meet critical deadlines without compromising on the quality of ongoing projects.
