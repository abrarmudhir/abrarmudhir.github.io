about: >-
      Trafigura is a leading commodities group, owned by its employees and founded over 30 years ago. At the heart of 
      global supply, Trafigura connects vital resources to power and build the world. We deploy infrastructure, 
      market expertise and our worldwide logistics network to move oil and petroleum products, metals and minerals, 
      gas and power from where they are produced to where they are needed, forming strong relationships that make 
      supply chains more efficient, secure and sustainable. We invest in renewable energy projects and technologies 
      to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, including through H2Energy Europe and joint venture 
      Nala Renewables. <br /><br />
  
      The Trafigura Group also comprises industrial assets and operating businesses including multi-metals producer 
      Nyrstar, fuel storage and distribution company Puma Energy, and our Impala Terminals joint venture. The Group 
      employs over 12,000 people, of which over 1,400 are shareholders and is active in 156 countries. <br /><br />
  
      At the heart of global supply, Trafigura connects vital resources to power and build the world. Through our 
      Metals and Minerals, Oil & Petroleum Products and Gas, Power and Renewables, commercial divisions, 
      we use infrastructure, logistics and financing to connect producers and consumers, using our deep understanding 
      of the markets we serve to make supply more efficient, secure and sustainable.<br /><br />
  
      We are accelerating our investments in renewable energy, including hydrogen, ammonia and other low-carbon energy 
      technologies required for the transition to a low carbon future. We are committed to responsible business 
      practices and we work with our stakeholders to improve environmental and social standards, bringing greater 
      trust and transparency to global supply chains.<br /><br />
  
      A career at Trafigura offers a gateway to working on some of the most exciting challenges of a rapidly changing 
      world â€“ from helping to optimise supply chains to developing infrastructure and new markets. In a culture that is 
      founded on openness and energy, our people work as part of a multinational, globally connected team and thrive in 
      a fast-paced environment where they can nurture and commercialise bold ideas. Everyone has a voice and is 
      empowered to collaborate across geographies and disciplines to help shape our business and the wider world. 
      We know the importance and value of diversity in our business and we invest in attracting, developing and 
      retaining talent from all backgrounds.<br /><br />
