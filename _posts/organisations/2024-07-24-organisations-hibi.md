about: >-
      For the 1 in 6 families caring for children with developmental differences & health conditions, 
      the experience can be overwhelming, isolating and complex. 
      
      A lack of support results in poor health outcomes and unnecessary costs to the health, care & education systems. 
      
      Hibi provides a platform that for the first time provides scalable support to manage, coordinate and navigate care.
