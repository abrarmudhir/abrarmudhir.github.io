about: >-
      Pemberton Asset Management is a leading European private credit manager, distinguished by its innovative approach, 
      superior credit analysis, and extensive network of local offices across Europe. The firm has evolved from its 
      origins in direct lending to a diversified, multi-strategy private credit platform that supports investors in 
      achieving their objectives. Backed by Legal & General, one of Europe's largest insurers, 
      Pemberton offers a range of financing solutions for borrowers and investment opportunities for 
      institutional investors.<br /><br />

      Pemberton combines asset management with banking expertise, allowing it to originate, select, and manage diverse 
      credit exposures effectively through its on-the-ground offices. This network makes Pemberton an attractive partner 
      for institutional investors seeking better yields and enhanced downside protection compared to liquid credit 
      instruments.<br /><br />

      With a global investor base that includes insurance companies, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, 
      and family offices, Pemberton's strategies have garnered long-term partnerships and significant investments. 
      As of June 2024, Pemberton manages USD $22 billion in assets under management (AuM) and employs over 190 staff 
      globally. The firm is also a leader in responsible investing, with a strong focus on talent recruitment, 
      development, and workforce diversity.<br /><br />

      In 2021, Pemberton published a "Review and Outlook of European Direct Lending" in collaboration with 
      Sa√Ød Business School at the University of Oxford, supported by proprietary data and legal insights from 
      Latham & Watkins, underscoring its commitment to transparency and thought leadership in the industry. <br /><br />
