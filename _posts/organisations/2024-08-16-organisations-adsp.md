about: >-
      Applied Data Science Partners (ADSP) is an innovative consultancy dedicated to delivering value through the 
      application of data science and AI.<br /><br />
  
      Founded in 2016, ADSP is a consultancy that provides businesses with world-class data science and AI solutions 
      that deliver long-term value. We are a team of data engineers, scientists and architects who understand what it 
      takes to meet this objective, every time.<br /><br />
  
      Every one of our projects is bespoke, but there are some core themes that run throughout our work.<br /><br />
  
      We favour a highly communicative approach - we take the time to meet with your team and establish the optimal way 
      to utilise the data you are collecting. We also value transparency in our models - our data scientists know how 
      to build state-of-the-art, interpretable models that predict, optimise and provide actionable recommendations. 
      Lastly, we love automation - our highly skilled data engineers know the best way to deploy and scale the solution 
      so that your business can start feeling the benefits of the project right away.<br /><br />
  
      Above all, our clients value our ability to transfer knowledge of the solution to internal stakeholders, 
      both from a technical and non-technical perspective. We do this by spending time on-site with your team to walk 
      through the deliverables in person. Our goal is to build solutions that feel part of the everyday running of your 
      business and measurably contribute to its success. We care that the services that we provide stand 
      the test of time.<br /><br />
  
      By engaging with us you can expect the highest quality of service and delivery on every project. Through our 
      combined experience, we have developed a best-practice approach to developing AI technology, ensuring our clients 
      are able to take advantage of the huge opportunities offered by the application of machine 
      learning and data science.<br /><br />
  
      If you'd like to know more about any of our services or previous projects, please do reach out and we'd be happy 
      to discuss further.<br /><br />
