      Pay.UK maintains and develops the UK retail payment systems and standards that are core to the economy being able 
      to function on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />
  
      From Bacs to Faster Payments and cheques – we act as the single operator for all UK retail payments. We put the 
      needs of consumers and businesses at the heart of everything we do, working in the public interest to ensure that 
      the systems the country relies on for its banking transactions are safe, open, innovative and resilient.<br /><br />

      Our payment systems underpin the services that enable funds to be transferred between people and institutions. 
      In 2022, the UK's retail payment systems processed 11.1 billion transactions worth £7.9 trillion through 
      Bacs Direct Credit, Direct Debit, Faster Payments, and cheques, and our Current Account Switch Service has 
      facilitated over 9 million switches since it’s launch in 2013.<br /><br />

      Every day, individuals and businesses use the services we provide to get their salaries, pay their bills and make 
      online and mobile banking payments. Our vision for the future is to enable a vibrant economy, with Pay.UK 
      delivering the best-in-class payment infrastructure and standards for the benefit of consumers and 
      businesses nationwide.
