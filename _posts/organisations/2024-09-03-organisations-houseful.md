about: >-
      We’ve recently renamed our wider business to ‘Houseful’, which is why the name might be new to you. By doing so, 
      we can now showcase the breadth of our brands and connected capabilities that are driving progress in the 
      property industry. <br /><br />

      Houseful is the leader in residential property software, data and insight - owning and operating a family of 
      trusted and established brands, including Zoopla, Hometrack, Prime Location, Mojo, Alto and Calcasa.<br /><br />

      It also means that when you work for one of our brands, you’re part of something much bigger. At Houseful, 
      we are powering better property decisions for everyone - and our door is always open to new applicants, 
      regardless of race, colour, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, 
      physical disability, or length of time spent unemployed.<br /><br />
