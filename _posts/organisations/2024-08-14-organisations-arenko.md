about: >-
      Our vision is a zero carbon grid worldwide.<br /><br />
  
      As we move to the high-renewables and low carbon era, electricity storage is transforming the way the energy 
      industry operates. The energy industry is fast becoming a digital and multidisciplinary sector that provides a 
      fundamental service for modern society, but these needs must be delivered in a socially responsible way. 
      Arenko is using new technology to add flexibility to the grid and secure supply in this fast-changing industry, 
      offering a huge variety of opportunities for the future. At Arenko we are strongly committed to our mission of 
      building a sustainable future by enabling a zero-carbon grid worldwide. Energy storage has a crucial role to play 
      in the energy transition, and our technology enables the transformation of energy systems. We have committed a 
      Sustainability Strategy. <br /><br />
  
      Arenko’s market-leading software platform uses the power of automation and machine learning to identify and 
      unlock the value of batteries and renewables.<br /><br />
  
      Arenko’s technology optimises the technical and commercial performance of flexible assets in real time.<br /><br />
  
      It’s designed by a team of data science and market experts to maximise the availability and profitability of 
      energy storage and generation in order to accelerate the transition to a fully decarbonised power system.<br /><br />
  
      Arenko was founded in 2014 to become the dominant player in energy. Since then, we have built a world class team. 
      Arenko is growing rapidly in the emerging energy storage sector and has been operating live assets since mid-2016. 
      If this makes you buzz with excitement then get on board and apply.<br /><br />
  
      At Arenko we value motivated, flexible people who are team players and willing to change the status quo. 
      We want every employee to feel valued, comfortable and able to be their own free self at work. Together, 
      we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that encourages, supports and empowers the authentic 
      voices of all our employees. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to 
      race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics,
